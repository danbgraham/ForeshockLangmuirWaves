# ForeshockLangmuirWaves

Scripts and database files for study of Langmuir waves in Earth's foreshock using MMS observations. 

# Abstract

At Earth's quasi-perpendicular bow shock, electrons can be reflected and accelerated to high velocities, forming beams. These beams excite Langmuir and beam-mode waves in the electron foreshock region. The waves can then be converted to radio waves, which can be detected remotely, via linear or nonlinear processes. We investigate the properties of the Langmuir waves excited in the electron foreshock region using the three-dimensional electric field measured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Distinct spectral peaks near the plasma frequency are often observed, suggestive of simultaneous observations of beam-mode and Langmuir waves, as well as nonlinear electrostatic decay or reflection off density gradients. In addition, the electric fields often have large perpendicular components, consistent with low wave number Z-mode waves, which indicate that linear mode conversion may be a viable source of radio waves. The statistical results show that the electric fields are largest near the electron foreshock boundary with the solar wind. Both the parallel and perpendicular components of the electric field exhibit close to log-normal probability distribution functions, consistent with predictions from Stochastic Growth Theory. These results suggest that density perturbations, in addition to nonlinear three-wave decay, are crucial to the evolution of Langmuir waves and generation of radio waves at the plasma frequency and second harmonic. These results are relevant to Langmuir waves in the solar wind, such as in Type II and Type III solar radio bursts, where large-amplitude beam-driven Langmuir waves with similar properties are observed.
